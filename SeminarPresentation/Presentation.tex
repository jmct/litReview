% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection[Motivation]{Motivation}

\begin{frame}{Why Functional Programming?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            Parallel programming in imperative style is difficult. The lack of state in
            functional programs provides an advantage \citep{PFPAnIntro}.
        \item
            The largest successes in large scale parallelism have come from the declarative
            and functional paradigms (Databases, Map/Reduce).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What's taken to long?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            Throughout the 80's researchers worked on parallel graph reduction for functional
            programs. However, the research could not keep up with the massive increase
            in single CPU processing speed/power. 
        \item
            Moore's law is still holding, but single thread CPUs are not seeing the same speed
            increases. Additional power is continually coming from increasing the number of 
            processing cores.
             
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Abstract Machines}
\subsection[Design Choices for Parallel Implementations of Functional Languages]{Design Choices for Parallel Implementations of FL}

\begin{frame}{Abstract Machines: Design Choices \citep{clackBook}}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Graph can be stored centrally, or distributed amongst several memories;
        \item Each processing agent is made up of \emph{one or more} sequential abstract
                machines that execute a thread;
        \item Threads that are not being executed reside in one or more thread pools, threads
                that have not begun evaluation are known as sparks.
        \item Synchronization is required between processing agents when the result of a reduction
                is needed by another thread. 
    \end{enumerate}
