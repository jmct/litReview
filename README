This repository will probably be organized as follows:

-Main list of books, papers, and other publications relevent to my research.

-BibTeX file of said book, papers...

-Directory containing outlines/notes on a selection of the papers

-Directory containing the work on the literature review itself. 

This may change as time goes on but for now this is the plan.
